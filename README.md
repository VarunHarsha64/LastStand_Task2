## Game Concept
Defend yourself against a relentless zombie apocalypse. Set up a base to protect yourself before the invasion begins. As the game starts, zombies invade from both sides, attempting to reach the survivor. Zombies damage and destroy any blocks in their path, allowing them to advance. The survivor can move and shoot zombies to prevent them from getting close. The game ends if the survivor loses all health and is overtaken by the zombies.

## Modes

### Normal Mode
- Create your own 2D world similar to the one in the illustration which consists of a survivor and defense blocks.
- The survivor can move left, right, jump (obeying gravity), and shoot zombies through his weapon.
- Add gravity to the ammunition which is fired from the weapon, i.e., it must follow a projectile motion.
- Implement basic game features like pause, play, scoring system, and leader-board.

### Hacker Mode
- Implement power-ups for the survivor (like temporary immunity, increased ammunition rate, etc).
- Allow the player to have different types of weapons and the ability to switch between them.
- Add different abilities to zombies (for example: climber zombie).
- Implement character animations using sprite sheets.

### Hacker++ Mode
- During the preparation phase, enable the player to place defensive items like mines, traps, and blocks from the inventory.
- Add automated defenses that can kill zombies and assist the survivor.
- Equip the survivor with a jetpack.
- Implement weapon recoil for added realism.
- Use a dynamic camera that focuses on the survivor and follows their movements.

## Gameplay Overview
- Player faces off against the Zombie wave.
